# Phase 8.1 Test Results - 2025-07-21 14:28:50

## Critical Issues Found:

### 1. File Permission Problem
- **Error**: `Unix.Unix_error(Unix.EACCES, "open", "/workspace/step_1.ml")`
- **Cause**: Docker container running as different user cannot write to host-mounted volume
- **Impact**: Complete failure of file generation

### 2. Hardcoded Source File References  
- **Error**: System tried to read "game.py" instead of "simple.py"
- **Location**: `/lib/template_free_decomposer.ml:231`
- **Code**: `create_autonomous_microtasks config "game.py" "OCaml"`
- **Impact**: Wrong source file analysis

### 3. API Malformed Function Call
- **Error**: `"finishReason": "MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL"`
- **Impact**: LLM response parsing failure

### 4. Logic Flow Issues
- **Issue**: Read operation failed but system continued to generate code
- **Issue**: No validation that source file exists before processing
- **Issue**: Hardcoded assumptions about file names

## Test Validation Results:

❌ **Does the LLM follow the required workflow (read_file FIRST)?** 
   - NO: System tried read_file but failed, then continued anyway

❌ **Does it analyze the Python code structure?**
   - NO: Never successfully read the source file

❌ **Does it generate actual OCaml code?**
   - PARTIAL: Generated OCaml code but unrelated to source
   - Generated exception handling code instead of translation

❌ **Is the OCaml code written to /workspace/translated.ml?**
   - NO: Permission denied, no files created

❌ **Does the generated code make sense as a translation?**
   - NO: Generated generic exception handling, not Python translation

## Overall Assessment:
Phase 8.1 fix FAILED - System shows multiple fundamental issues that prevent basic functionality.

## Required Fixes:
1. Fix Docker file permissions (run as correct user)
2. Remove hardcoded file references - make system detect actual source files
3. Fix API prompt that causes malformed function calls
4. Add proper validation for file existence before processing
5. Improve error handling to stop execution when critical steps fail
