The error message in the build output is:
File "dune", line 1, characters 0-5:
1 | Okay, I see a list of files and directories. What can I do for you? For example, I can read a file, write a file, list files in a directory, execute a shell command, build an OCaml project, run tests, clean build artifacts, edit a file, search files, analyze the project, or rename a module.

Error: S-expression of the form (<name> <values>...) expected
This indicates that the `dune` file is not a valid dune file. It seems like the LLM wrote a description of what it can do into the dune file instead of the actual dune file contents.

The dune file should contain s-expressions describing the build rules.
Since we are just starting, let's create a minimal dune file that defines a library.

 (name step_1))
